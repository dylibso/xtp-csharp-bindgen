# XTP Plugin Bindgen

> _Warning_: This is very experimental and is still in the prototyping phase.
> Changes will be made without warning. Please wait before you start writing new
> bindgens.

This repository houses the prototype for bingden for go plug-ins in XTP. It's
based on the
[XTP Schema](https://docs.xtp.dylibso.com/docs/host-usage/xtp-schema) as the
driving document. This document will be used to generate code and documentation
for plug-in systems and is specifically tailored to
[Extism](https://extism.org/) at the moment.

When this is integrated into CLI, usage will look something like:

```bash
xtp gen --template @dylibso/xtp-go-bindgen --path ~/my-plugin
```

This will grab the `bundle.zip` which contains the plugin and templates from the
[latest release](https://github.com/dylibso/xtp-go-bindgen/releases/latest).

[Here is my initial document](DESIGN.md) stating the design of the system.
However things are changing as I'm implementing. This codebase contains a mix of
go code and typescript code in order to bootstrap the system. But eventually all
Go code will be genericized and moved into the XTP CLI. A generator will only be
an Extism (usually TypeScript) plugin with some templates and a config file.
